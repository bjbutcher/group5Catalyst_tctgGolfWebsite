      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Burning Ridge Golf Club is a course with a fun layout
        and a character of its own. Whether you’re a high handicap golfer
        looking for an enjoyable round, or a scratch golfer looking for a
        great test of your game, Burning Ridge can accommodate your need. It
        is said that if you can play well here, you can play well anywhere! We
        hope you’ll come see this for yourself.<br /><br />Burning Ridge
        boasts a large membership, and we are constantly planning fun events
        for them. We also run more tournaments than most in the Grand Strand
        area.<br /><br />We are known as a very woman-friendly club, and this
        is reflected in our large contingent of female members and ladies
        groups. We have two women’s leagues: the Ridge Runners, a member group
        of 16-20 who play once a week, and the Palmetto Ladies League, 24-40
        women who consider Burning Ridge their home course. Our women’s tees
        are thoughtfully laid out for meaningful play, and our
        women-member-designed lounge, with its great attention to detail,
        attests to our women-friendly philosophy.<br /><br />The Burning Ridge
        history originally began as a 36-hole course, divided into an East
        course and a West course. The West course was closed for residential
        development in 2005, at which time the East course underwent extensive
        renovation.<br /><br />Located in central Myrtle Beach on Highway 501,
        the primary artery into Myrtle Beach, Burning Ridge Golf Club is only
        10 miles to the Atlantic Ocean and the heart of Myrtle Beach. Consider
        playing a round at Burning Ridge on your way into Myrtle Beach or on
        your way back home.</p>
